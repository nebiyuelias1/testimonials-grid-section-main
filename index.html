              transition and have heard some people who had an amazing experience here. I signed up
              for the free intro course and found it incredibly fun! I enrolled shortly thereafter.
              The next 12 weeks was the best - and most grueling - time of my life. Since completing
              the course, I’ve successfully switched careers, working as a Software Engineer at a VR startup. ”

            “ Before joining the bootcamp, I’ve never written a line of code. I needed some structure from
            professionals who can help me learn programming step by step. I was encouraged to enroll by a former
            student of theirs who can only say wonderful things about the program. The entire curriculum and staff
            did not disappoint. They were very hands-on and I never had to wait long for assistance. The agile team
            project, in particular, was outstanding. It took my learning to the next level in a way that no tutorial
            could ever have. In fact, I’ve often referred to it during interviews as an example of my developent
            experience. It certainly helped me land a job as a full-stack developer after receiving multiple offers.
            100% recommend! ”
